h3. Brackish Water

Oh just jump in
There's no one but us

This water formed of a stream and the sea
Out on the edge of a black rock beach
When the water rises we'll leave it be

But oh just jump in
It's only you and me

Brackish water
Just like our tears
Mine were saline
But yours ran clear



h3. The Ocean Spins Backwards

Did you run far away?
Well the Earth is round so how far can you run at all?
We end where we start
Fitting how this universe goes round in rings, wouldn't you say?
Attached to this notion that love is an ocean

(Chorus)
On the road, you crossed an ocean
Just to find her anyway (you were)
So determined but it comes to you
That wanderers don't stay (do they?)
Every wave that pulled you under
Left you in her wake (and don't you)

Think that currents might mean something
When the ocean spins backwards

A hundred hellos
But a hundred and one goodbyes---that doesn't add up at all
I'm told we're a wheel
And you wouldn't be the last to love her, wouldn't you say?
These broken emotions; your love is no ocean

(Cause oceans are...)

(Jam/Solo)

You wished for time to be
Bolder, not older
The spirit to hold her
Thought over and over
Of the one thing you told her
You wished to console her
This dream that you sold her
You wanted to show her
That you really know her
But here in October
There's nothing you owe her
And time is much slower
For those left over
But if spirits get lower
And this thing blows over
The ocean spins closer (backwards)
Now backwards (faster) and colder

Oh and the ocean... how could you let me down?

(Chorus)

The ocean spins backwards for you
My love is no ocean
But oh, how could you let me down
Oh, the last to love her

On the road, I crossed an ocean
Just to find you anyway (I was)
So determined but it comes to me
That wanderers won't stay (will they)
Every wave that pulled me under
Left me in your wake (oh, could you let me)

Feel the ocean spinning backwards some days



h3. Six Kilometers to Edoras

I ran as far as the road went
Got as far as the Rangitata
(Hey do you mind? I'm trying to do a serious song here!)

Clouds sat close on the mountains
Hate to run back now, but I gotta
(Are you going to talk like that the entire time?)

I wore my socks, it was cold out
See it's backwards here as far as seasons go
(That's not the only thing that's backwards...)

We're goin' out to the mountains
I do hope we get to see the first snow
(Just do the bass solo, ok?)

(Bass solo)

We drove the trail to a ghost town
Sure got quiet after the gold rush
(Yeah... until now)

We drove straight through the rivers
Man we ended up in some barren brush
(It'd be a shame if we lost you)

I tried my luck with a gold pan
I heard a few shakes is all it takes
(Ok, who told you that?)

My hands near froze in the river
Made out with only a couple a flakes
(Don't quit your job... Oh wait)

(Guitar solo)

Back at home on the floodplains
I looked for the southern cross
(Oh is that what you were doing?)

It sat so low on the horizon
Well I found it anyway, so no loss
(Dude you were totally looking in the wrong direction)

Each star burning so brightly
There's Mimosa pointing north (or was that south?)
(Why do I even...)

Each star was a reminder
A reminder of you, of course

And to stand on this land that no one has stood on
Bracing for the coming snow with only my hood on
And to drink from the river that fell from the peaks
Touched by the beauty of this nature that speaks

It's all alive right here waiting for us
So meet me there it's just six km to---


Please, oh please be gentle with my sometimes fragile heart, she said
And baby I swear for you I'll always do my part
I'm searching the night for stars in this unfamiliar hemisphere
But you're the only light I ever found my dear



h3. Mountaineers and Sailors

If I wandered the streets like you paced all your trails
Then you never did walk so I just tensioned my sail

And you passed by a river
Did you notice that it flowed to the sea
And the clouds in this valley
Oh they were wishful slivers

Cause skylit peaks---they are all you see, oh
In front of you now can you tell these are only cheeks... only cheeks

Your solid conviction
Like a vein of metal ore
Far from the veins of these hands you once so adored

The air that found my sail on the Pacific Ocean
Did you ever wonder what brought it here?
The autumn breeze that fell from your Rocky Mountains
It became the breath that only we could share

But however high you climb to be a mountaineer
Just don't look for sailors you won't find one there
I can see you naked you're looking from the bed
But what we slept on must have been our hearts instead

The air that found my sail on the Pacific Ocean
Did you ever wonder how it found me here?
The autumn breeze that fell from your Rocky Mountains
Became the breath that only we could share

I swore that I would always do my part for you
I cried for you in the way that only lovers do
I felt how my tears, oh, they fell on you
I moved in you in the way that only lovers do



h3. Proof That Journeys Never End

(A year ago in Austin)
Fell in love with a girl; she then asked me to stay
Those words have haunted me for a year, month, and a day

You know, I remember thinking then that she might be the one
But youth is as youth does and with tears I chose the road
leaving behind Austin and the Texas sun

Life is passion whether you're flying high or fallin' low
Hawaii called so I simply had to go
But it hardly matters the good that we intend
She might have said then that our journeys never end

And I met a friend and we loved to run
Our Maui smiles lit up in the setting sun
If it hadn't been for her I think I would have turned back home
Cause life on the road is awfully hard when you're alone
My heart was still tied when it came time to say our goodbyes
Indeed she left on her own

And I met a man who knew how to heal
Yeah my broken skin was hard to conceal
If it hadn't been for him I think I would have given up
There's only so much until you know you've had enough
But resilience is the strength you find within, you toughen up

Life is passion whether you're flying high or fallin' low
New Zealand called so I simply had to go
But it hardly matters the love that we wish to send
She might have said then that our journeys never end

And I met mother nature who took my breath away
Cloud connection over Kaikoura--just another day
If you hadn't told me about Crux, that's the Southern Cross
I think I would have never looked up into the semigloss
To realize our universe does go round in rings, wouldn't you say?

And Beijing to Paris to London
There's people in over-abundance
Oh, you would love these cities---they're energizing
I got lost in the shuffle---it was minimizing
But the thought of sharing Paris with you was...
in a word: tantalizing

Life is passion whether you're flying high or fallin' low
Sweden called so I simply had to go
But it hardly matters even if we overextend
You might have guessed then that our journeys never end

And I met so many people on the road this year
But in all of Sweden, there was only you my dear
If it hadn't been for you I think I would have felt a new spark
Yet here we are, sitting together in the park
Did you recognize this as a simple twist of fate?
In any case, it's left its mark

(A month ago in Stockholm)
Just friends but she greeted me with a kiss
I spent the next four nights dreaming only of her lips

I knew that she had to be the one, I'll stay---I was so determined
But I overlooked the fact that she was no longer nearly as certain

Life is passion whether you're flying high or fallin' low
It's been a year alright but this is as far as I can go
See it hardly matters even if our travels do suspend
I should have guessed then that our journeys never end

(A day ago in New Jersey)
She wrote back saying that she had to move out west
Found myself thinking that it might be for the best

I suppose there was something there she had to find and find alone
Maybe I'm searching for it too, but it seems... no place feels like home

And I understand that you left because your life here said leave
And that you'll drive out west to the highest of peaks
But I wish instead that you had chosen me for those
Magical weeks
Beyond all critique
Yet my heart will now be
An instant antique
Put on display
In your storied boutique
And that's the only way
It keeps

Life is passion whether you're flying high or fallin' low
Time is all we have but sometimes it pays to take it slow
But it hardly matters the truth we wish to defend
Cause she proved to me then that our journeys... our journeys never end

(Instrumental build)

You wanted to move out west but I wanted it too
I wish you only the best, this much is true
With every mile made yours, can you tell I've thought it through?
But just remember this: some journeys were meant for two

If our paths do cross one more time
We'll leave it to fate and she'll decide
But I'm told she's an elegant cold-hearted whore
For this kind of irony she so adores

Do you think our love is stronger than steel
Then why say no when I just kneeled
I can only say that I won't pretend
Cause at last I thought that my journey ends

But it don't end, no no no
It don't end, no no no

Our journeys never end

Take this as proof that our journeys never end

Our journeys never end
